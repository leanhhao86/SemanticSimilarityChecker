# Semantic Similarity Checker

A pet project to try my hand at NLP coding.
This small tool checks for similarity between two sentences using Object-Action model from the paper:
*Mukherjee, I., Kumar, B., Singh, S. and Sharma, K., 2018. Plagiarism detection based on semantic analysis. International Journal of Knowledge and Learning, 12(3), pp.242-254.*
Further development:
 - Refine the method regarding its similarity threshold.
 - Check for similarity between two documents (A plagiarism checker).
